A Widget toolbox that adds visibility management and helps to control where widgets are shown efficiently.

== Description ==

Widgets Control is a toolbox that features visibility management for every widget.
It allows to show widgets based on conditions -
you can choose to show widgets only on certain pages or
exclude widgets from being displayed.

For each widget, you can decide where it should be displayed:

- show a widget on all pages
- show it on some pages
- show it on all except some pages

To include or exclude pages, the plugin allows you to indicate page ids, titles or slugs and tokens that identify the front page, categories, tags, etc.

In addition to page ids, titles and slugs, these tokens can be used to determine where a widget should or should not be displayed:

<code>[home] [front] [single] [page] [category] ...</code>

See the [documentation](http://docs.itthinx.com/document/widgets-control/) for more details.
